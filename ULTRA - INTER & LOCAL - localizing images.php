!!INTER & LOCAL - LOCALIZING IMAGES!!

> want to display images that have text in them and have that text in a 
Localeappropriate language

> Make an image directory for each locale you want to support, as well as a global image directory for 
images that have no locale-specific information in them. 
	>> Create copies of each locale-specific image in the appropriate locale-specific directory. 
	>> Make sure that the images have the same filename in the different directories. 
	>> Instead of printing out image URLs directly, treat their paths as localizable strings, either by 
	explicitly storing them in your message catalogs or by computing the right path at runtime
