!!BASIC COOKIE!!

> use it so hat your website can recognize subsequent requests from the same web browser (same user)
> ALERT < 
	Cookies are sent with the HTTP headers, so if youâ€™re not using output buffering, set cookie() must be called before any output is generated
	
> $expirationTime - expressed as an epoch timestamp
	> If the $expirateionTIME is missing (or empty), the cookie expires when the browser is closed
> $path - cookie is sent back to the server only when pages whose path begin with the specified string are requested
> $domain - cookie is sent back to the server only when pages whose hostname ends with the specified domain are requested
> $flag - if set to true, instructs the browser only to send the cookie over an SSL connection
	> usefull when cookie contains sensitive information

*time - returns the current time measured in the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT)

> deleting cookie - The call to setcookie() to delete a cookie has to have the same arguments (except for value and time)
	> that means $path, $domain & $flag if arguments used in creating a cookie
