!!API - CONSUMING RESTFul APIs!!

> Used for:
	>> find out the weather forecast for New York City
	>> the latest tweets from @rasmus
	>> or update a stored file
- you can write a short REST script to process that data in a format you can easily manipulate

> REST is a straightforward style of web APIs in which you make requests to a URL using HTTP methods, such as GET and POST. 
> The URL and body, often in JSON or XML, describes the resource you want to manipulate and the method tells the server what
action it should take
	>> GET tells the server you want to retrieve existing data
	>> POST means you want to add a new resource. 
	>> PUT to replace a resource or create a specifically named resource
	>> DELETE deletes the resource
