!!FILES - READING & WRITING CUSTOM FILE TYPES!!

> You want to use PHPâ€™s standard file access functions to provide access to data that might
not be in a file. 
	>> npr. you want to use file access functions to read from and write to shared memory. 
	>> or npr. or you want to process file contents when they are read before they reach PHP
	
> Stream wrappers handle the details of moving data back and forth between PHP and your custom 
location or your custom format. 
	>> This class implements the methods PHP needs to access your custom data stream: 
	opening, closing, reading, writing, and so on.
	>> A particular wrapper is registered with a particular prefix. You use that prefix when
	passing a filename to fopen(), include(), or any other PHP file-handling function to
	ensure that your wrapper is invoked.
> Stream wrappers are handy for nonfile data sources, but they can also be used to preprocess
file contents on their way into PHP. Example below demonstrates a clever example of this as 
applied to templating. 
	>> With short_open_tags turned off, printing an object instance variable in a template 
	requires the comparatively verbose <?php echo $this->property; ?>. 
	>> This solution uses a stream wrapper that allows the @ character to stand in for echo $this->.
	

> VISIBILITY
	- public		can be accessed everywhere
	- private		can only be accessed by the class that defines it
	- protected		can be accessed only within the class itself and by inherited classes (children)
	- static		properties or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an instantiation of the class
						> pseudo-variable $this is not available inside the method


*stream_register_wrapper - register a URL wrapper implemented as a PHP class
							- use stream_wrapper_register instead
*fopen - opens file or URL
*fwrite - binary-safe file write
*time - return current Unix timestamp
*fclose - closes an open file pointer
*str_replace - replace all occurrences of the search string with the replacement string
*file_get_contents - reads entire file into a string
*stat - gives information about a file
*ini_get - gets the value of a configuration option
*preg_replace - perform a regular expression search and replace
*strlen - get string length
*dirname - returns a parent directory's path
*in_array - checks if a value exists in an array
