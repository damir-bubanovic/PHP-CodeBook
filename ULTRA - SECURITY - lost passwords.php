!!SECURITY - LOST PASSWORDS!!

> want to issue a password to a user who has lost her password

> If a user forgets her password, generate a new password and send that to her email address
> Complicated - To avoid disclosing a new password by email at all, let a user authenticate 
herself without a password by answering one or more personal questions 
(the answers to which you have on file)

> You could also just email the user a one-time-use URL. When she visits that URL, show her
a page that lets her reset her password. 
	>> If the URL is sufficiently hard to guess, then you can be confident that only the 
		email recipient will access it

*chr - return a specific character
*mt_rand - generate a better random value
*password_hash - creates a password hash
*mail - send mail
