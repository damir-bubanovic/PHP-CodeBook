!!USING COOKIE AUTHENTIFICATION!!

> You want more control over the user login procedure, such as presenting your own login form

> Using cookie or session authentication instead of HTTP Basic authentication makes it much easier for users to log out: 
you just delete their login cookie or remove the login variable from their session

*setcookie - defines a cookie to be sent along with the rest of the HTTP headers
*md5 - calculate the md5 hash of a string (but use password hash & verify)
*unset - destroys the specified variables
*list - assign variables as if they were an array
*explode - returns an array of strings, each of which is a substring of string formed by splitting it on boundaries formed by the string delimiter.
*error_log - sends an error message to the web server's error log or to a file
	> writes a message to the error log, but it could just as easily record the information in a database that you could use in your analysis of site usage and traffic
*session_id - used to get or set the session id for the current session

> ALERT < 
	One danger of using session IDs is that sessions are hijackable, if you guess session ID you can masquerade as specific user to the server.
	See anti-hacking directives for Session ID - session.entropy_file & session.entropy_length
