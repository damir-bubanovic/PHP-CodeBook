!!XML - BASIC!!

> XML is a popular data-exchange, configuration, and message-passing format
	>> Although JSON has displaced XML for many basic situations
	
> XML provides developers with a structured way to mark up data with tags arranged in a tree-like hierarchy

> Another view of XML is as a document representation language
	>> PDF book was writte in XML (has writing & displaying features like Word)

> PHP has a set of XML extensions that:
	• Work together as a unified whole
	• Are standardized on a single XML library: libxml2
	• Fully comply with W3C specifications
	• Efficiently process data
	• Provide you with the right XML tool for your job
	
> SimpleXML extension allows you to interact with the information in an XML document as though these pieces 
of information are arrays and objects, iterating through them with foreach loops and editing them in place 
merely by assigning new values to variables
