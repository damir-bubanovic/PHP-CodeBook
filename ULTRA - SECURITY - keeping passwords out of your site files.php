!!SECURITY - KEEPING PASSWORDS OUT OF YOUR SITE FILES!!

> You need to use a password to connect to a database, 
	>> npr. you donâ€™t want to put the password in the PHP files you 
	use on your site in case those files are exposed

> This technique removes passwords from the source code of your pages, but it makes them available 
in other places that need to be protected. 
	>> make sure that there are no publicly viewable pages that call phpinfo(). 
	>> make sure not to expose the contents of $_SERVER in other ways, such as with the print_r() function.
	>> if you are using a shared host, make sure the environment variables are set in such a way that they 
	are only available to your virtual host, not to all users. 
		>> With Apache, set the variables in a separate file from the main configuration file
