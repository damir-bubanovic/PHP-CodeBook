!!PACKAGES!!

> Packages and libraries allow you to not reinvent the wheel. This shows you how to use three
collections of packages: 
	Composer, PEAR, and PECL. 

> Each provides a set of tools for you to easily incorporate packages into your own code, 
and even contribute packages of your own back to the common collective.

	+) Composer is a dependency manager. Use it to install the code, including any external
	packages, needed by the libraries you want use. 
	> Composer makes it simple to wrangle the proper versions of code into your projects, 
	both when you begin the project and when you decide to upgrade a package to a newer release. 
	> Packagist, the primary place to find Composer packages, has tens of thousands PHP packages.
	
	+) PEAR is the PHP Extension and Application Repository, a collection of open source
	classes that work together. 
	> Developers can use PEAR classes to parse XML, implement authentication systems, 
	generate CAPTCHAs, send MIME mail with attachments, and a wide variety of other common 
	(and not so common) tasks.
	
	+) PECL is the PHP Extension Community Library. PECL, pronounced “pickle,” is a series
	of extensions to PHP written in C. 
	> These extensions are just like the ones distributed with the main PHP release, but they’re 
	of more specialized interest—such as a MongoDB database driver or an OAuth 1.0 extension
