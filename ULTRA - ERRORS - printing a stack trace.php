!!ERRORS - PRINTING A STACK TRACE!!

> want to know whatâ€™s happening at a specific point in your program, 
and what happened leading up to that point

1. option) debug_print_backtrace() function allows you to quickly get a sense of what has 
been been going on in your application immediately before you called a particular
function
	>> The more complicated your application, the more information you can expect 
	to have returned from the backtrace functions
	>> For debugging larger codebases, you may achieve bug-hunting success more quickly 
	using a full debugging extension, such as Xdebug, or an integrated development 
	environment (IDE), such as NetBeans, 
		+) supports setting breakpoints
		+) stepping in and out of blocks of code
		+) watching the evolution of variables...
> If all you need is a little more information than you can get from sprinkling print: 
	'Here I am on line ' . LINE; statements throughout your code, debug_print_back trace()


2. option) debug_backtrace() - Instead of outputting the backtrace, debug_backtrace() 
returns it as an array, one element per stack frame. 
	>> useful if you only need to print certain elements of the backtrace, or you
	want to manipulate it programmatically

> VISIBILITY
	- public		can be accessed everywhere
	- private		can only be accessed by the class that defines it
	- protected		can be accessed only within the class itself and by inherited classes (children)
	- static		properties or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an instantiation of the class
						> pseudo-variable $this is not available inside the method


*debug_print_backtrace - prints a backtrace
*debug_backtrace - generates a backtrace
*count - count all elements in an array, or something in an object
